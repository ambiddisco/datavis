# William Ambrosetti

My expectations going into this project:

<br>

<span class="special">Strength:</span>
I am capable of efficiently programming, manipulating and exploring data, as well as creating simple visualisations.

<br>

<span class="special">Weakness:</span>
I have a difficult time finding correaltions in the data that allow to follow the research objectives, and have to make many visualisations to reach them.

<br>

<span class="special">Goal:</span>
I would like to find a different view on the facts we thought we knew the answer for, by exploring new facets of data that may initially seem ordinary.
