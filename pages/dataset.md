Dataset link: [Motorvehicle collisions dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)

<br>

We decided to focus our research on motorvehicle collisions, as you don't get much more man-made than that.

<br>

This dataset was taken from the website <span class="special">"cityofnewyork.us"</span>, is released by the <span class="special">NYPD</span>, and is automatically updated daily. The data spans the period from 2014 to the current day.

In its original form, it contains 2.1mil rows and 29 columns.
