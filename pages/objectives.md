# Research Questions

We have chosen to dedicate our project to motorvehicle collisions in New York, as not only is this a very man-made subject - relating both to human's inventions and actions - but it provides information that we may use to become better drivers ourselves.

<br>

We intend to perform research and visualisations relating to the following questions:

<br>

- Are there any areas more likely to involve crashes? Which areas should I avoid?
- At what time are crashes the most and least likely to happen?
- Which motorvehicles are the most dangerous to own in New York? Which are the most deadly to encounter?
- Have any factors over the years affected the data in such a way as to create important outliers?

<br>

... As well as visualise a map of the city, with the different types of accidents.
