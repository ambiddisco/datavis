<br>

My expectations going into this project:

<br>

<span class="special">Strength:</span>
I'm confident in my ability to preprocess and clean data, in order to prioritise important features and visualise the initial project objectives.

<br>

<span class="special">Weakness:</span>
From last year's experience I can say that I'm slow at creating graphs, and not very good at linear regressions.

<br>

<span class="special">Goal:</span>
I intend to focus on making my visualisations more clear, and making pretty or visually interesting graphs, as pulling attention means communicating data more effectively.
